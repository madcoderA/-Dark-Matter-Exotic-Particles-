💕 I set up the code in different perspectives. We are not able to see dark matters. Think somehow we invert our visible light, and see how dark matter formed. The background should white to detect them clearly. The particles you see now is the exotic particles ( Hypothetical ) that exert a gravitational pull and create a dark matter. Click on the screen I add an effect when they vanished and visible photon ( white space ) extracted gradually. Enjoy...

Something more deeper👇

One leading hypothesis is that dark matter consists of exotic particles that don't interact with normal matter or light but that still exert a gravitational pull. Several scientific groups, including one at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, are currently working to generate dark matter particles for study in the lab. Unlike normal matter, dark matter does not interact with the electromagnetic force. This means it does not absorb, reflect or emit light, making it extremely hard to spot. In fact, researchers have been able to infer the existence of dark matter only from the gravitational effect it seems to have on visible matter.

Astronomers have developed an inordinate number of methods to probe the Universe, and all of them point towards one consistent picture of our cosmos. Over the past 13.8 billion years ⁠— the amount of time that's passed since the start of the hot Big Bang ⁠— our Universe has expanded, cooled, and gravitated from its initially dense, hot, and almost-perfectly uniform origin. Today, our observable Universe is enormous in scope: some 92 billion light-years across. It's filled with trillions of galaxies, clustered together in a great cosmic web, bathed in the Big Bang's leftover radiation at a minuscule temperature of just 2.73 K. But the biggest surprise is that the particles and fields we know of are insufficient, on their own, to explain the Universe we see. All the matter and radiation we know of, even combined, adds up to just 5% of the energy in the Universe. Two mysterious entities, dark matter (27%) and dark energy (68%), compose the rest.

Understanding what those dark components of the Universe are, including where they come from, are some of the great unsolved problems of the 21st century. There are a few things we can infer about both dark matter and dark energy from the observations we've accumulated.

Dark matter: it must have begun uniformly distributed throughout the Universe, with the same initial spectrum of density fluctuations that normal matter possessed. It must have been born cold (i.e., it was moving slowly compared to the speed of light even at early times), and it must not collide or interact (above a certain constrained threshold) with itself or any of the Standard Model particles. And it's responsible for most of the clumping and clustering in the Universe: its gravitational effects are five times as important as the effects if normal matter.

Dark energy: we know very little about this. It appears to be completely uniform and not to clump or cluster at all, and it appears to be 100% consistent with a cosmological constant, or of being a form of energy inherent to the vacuum of space itself. Its big effect is twofold, causing the Universe to be spatially flat and driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe, two facts that cannot be explained without it.

The evidence that exists for dark matter is overwhelming and comes in an enormous suite, but suffers from a distinct drawback from the ideal scenario: it's all indirect. We can observe the effects that dark matter has on the radiation and the normal matter in the Universe, and come up with many independent measurements that all point to that same 5-to-1 picture of the dark matter to normal matter ratio. In particular:

1. the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background,

2. the way galaxies cluster together on the largest scales,

3. gravitational lensing of isolated, X-ray emitting galaxy clusters,

4. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the early-time abundance of the light elements,

5. measurements of colliding galaxy groups and clusters,

6. peculiar velocities of interacting galaxy pairs

Many other sets of observations all necessitate the existence of dark matter. Even if we'd never measured an individual galaxy's rotation — which also supports the existence of dark matter — there's no way to explain all of what exists without dark matter.

There have been many attempts to directly detect whatever particle might be responsible for dark matter, but all the searches that have ever been carried out have either come up empty or have yielded results where the signal is only dubiously attributed to dark matter. Building large, underground detectors that look for exotic recoils arising from massive particles have placed very stringent constraints on dark matter's cross-section in a specific mass range, but have never seen such a particle. Similarly, axion detectors (which search for very light dark matter) have never seen an axion; new "dark sector" particles failed to appear at the LHC; even massive neutrino detectors haven't seen a signal that couldn't be explained by neutrinos combined with the known and expected backgrounds. Dark matter is a necessary ingredient of our Universe, but this failure to directly detect it means we don't know its particle properties, assuming it even is made up of particles.

If all of this is true — and it's the best working model of the Universe that modern science has — then when was all the dark matter in the Universe created? This is where things get interesting, because there are only a few general options, and they all come with caveats. Here are the best options.

1. During inflation, before the start of the hot Big Bang.

2. During reheating: the transition between inflation and the hot Big Bang.

3. During the earliest, most energetic stages of the hot Big Bang.

4. During a later phase of the hot Big Bang, due to a phase transition.

That's it; these are the only options, and they all have drawbacks.

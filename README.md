DISCLAIMER: The code is for educational purposes only. You can use it for educational purposes only not for commercial uses.  ðŸ’• I set up the code in different perspectives. We are not able to see dark matters. Think somehow we invert our visible light, and see how dark matter formed. The background should white to detect them clearly. The particles you see now is the exotic particles ( Hypothetical ) that exert a gravitational pull and create a dark matter. Click on the screen I add an effect when they vanished and visible photon ( white space ) extracted gradually. Enjoy...
